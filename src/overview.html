The jModbus project aims to provide Java libraries to
allow java based devices to comminciate as either master
or slave devices via ModbusRTU (Modbus), ModbusASCII (ModbusA) or 
ModbusTCP (Modnet).  The code is open source and designed to 
run on devices with a small footprint, such as the Dallas
Semiconductor TINI.

<A HREF="http://www.modbus.org">Open Modbus</A> and the 
<A HREF="http://www.modicon.com/openmbus">Modicon Modbus</A> site.  The modbus
protocol was orignally designed by <A HREF="http://www.schneiderelectric.com/">
Schneider Electric</A> (makers of Modicon PLCs) for communication 
with Modicon PLCs.
