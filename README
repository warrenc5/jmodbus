1 - Introduction

The jModbus project aims to provide Java libraries to
allow java based devices to comminciate as either master
or slave devices via ModbusRTU (Modbus), ModbusASCII (ModbusA) 
or ModbusTCP (Modnet).  The code is open source and designed to 
run on devices with a small footprint, such as the Dallas
Semiconductor TINI.

The class structure is OO by deisgn, hopefully allowing for 
extenmsions such as SEMI over ModbusTCP to be written easily. 

For more information relating to Modbus and Modbus TCP please 
refer to Open Modbus (www.openmodbus.org) and the Modicon 
Modbus site (www.modicon.com/openmodbus). The modbus protocol 
was orignally designed by Schneider Electric (makers 
of Modicon PLCs) for communication with Modicon PLCs. 

The development of this project is hosted by Sourceforge.  For
the most up to date code please see the home page at 
jmodbus.sourceforge.net

3 - System Requirments

Build the code from the source distribution you will need the following tools:

  1. A working java compiler, see www.java.sun.com for more details.

  2. If you wish to use the provided make files then you will need a working
     version of make, such as gnu make. see www.gnu.org for more details.  If
     you are working under a win32 environment you may want to look at
     cygwin at www.cygwin.com

  3. To build the ModbusASCII and ModbusRTU code you will need to have the
     appropriate packages for the javax.comm Commjunication API installed.

  4. If you wish to build the examples for the Dallas Semiconductor TINI you
     will need to have a working TINI software development kit that can be
     obtained from Dallas Semiconduction Corp. at www.ibutton.com/TINI/


4 - Make Files

We have attempted to write the make files in the most robust manner possible.  
However to build the examples for the TINI the following lines at the top
of the Makefile for each example project will need to be altered to reflect the
setup of your machine.
> 
> TINIBIN = /usr/java/tini/bin
> TINICLASSES = $(TINIBIN)/tiniclasses.jar
> OWCLASSES = $(TINIBIN)/owapi_dependencies_TINI_001.jar
> 
These three environment variables have been defined to make the compiler and 
TINIConverter commands much shorter and more understand.

To simplify things it is recomended that you build the jmodbus.jar
file and place this into you <jdk>\jre\lib\ext\ directory so that
it is excessible all the time, instead of having to add it to your
class path all the time (even though some of the example show this, for
those who do not want to do this.)
